# Listing

The Listing APP

- The Listing app, This app show listing of product 

I used SwiftUI with combine and The MVVM architecture pattern.

I’ve decided to use an MVVM architecture - this results in a clean code base and will make adding new functionality to the app more accessible.

- First, let’s define that "ViewModel" is responsible for business logic like getting data from the network layer.

- Second, let’s define that "View" is responsible for showing elements like listing and the progress bar by using swift UI.

- Finally, the Model represents application data.

I use combine because it's a framework that provides a declarative Swift API for processing values over time. These values can represent many kinds of asynchronous events.
